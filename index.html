                    Lewis Carroll, born Charles Lutwidge Dodgson on January 27, 1832, in Daresbury, Cheshire, England,
                    was the third of eleven children in a highly religious family. His father, a clergyman, encouraged
                    intellectual pursuits, and Carroll showed an early talent for mathematics, storytelling, and
                    wordplay.
                    <br><br>
                    Carroll's childhood was marked by his love of reading and inventing games to entertain his siblings.
                    His family life deeply influenced his creativity and interest in exploring imagination. These
                    formative experiences laid the foundation for his later literary works.

                    <strong>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</strong> was first published on July 4, 1865, under the
                    pseudonym Lewis Carroll. The story originated during a boating trip in 1862, when Carroll entertained the three
                    Liddell sisters—Lorina, Edith, and Alice—with a whimsical tale about a girl falling into a
                    fantastical world. Alice Liddell inspired the titular character, and she encouraged Carroll to write
                    the story down.
                    <br><br>
                    The book received widespread acclaim for its imaginative narrative, eccentric characters, and
                    playful logic. It became a cornerstone of children's literature, breaking away from the moralistic
                    tone common in 19th-century storytelling. Carroll's mathematical background also influenced the
                    book's structure, filled with puzzles and paradoxes.
                    <br><br>
                    Early editions of the book featured illustrations by John Tenniel, whose iconic artwork became
                    inseparable from the text and contributed to its success.

                    In 1871, Carroll published <strong>Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There</strong>, a
                    sequel to <strong>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</strong>. This book presented a mirrored world where logic
                    and physics operated in reverse, inspired by Carroll's fascination with reflection and symmetry.
                    <br><br>
                    The narrative used a chessboard structure, where Alice advanced as a pawn trying to become a queen.
                    It introduced new characters such as Tweedledee and Tweedledum, Humpty Dumpty, and the White Queen,
                    each adding depth to Carroll's imaginative universe.
                    <br><br>
                    Themes of identity, transformation, and language play were further explored in this sequel. While
                    slightly darker and more introspective than its predecessor, <strong>Through the Looking-Glass</strong> was met
                    with similar enthusiasm and secured Carroll's reputation as a literary pioneer.

                    Lewis Carroll died on January 14, 1898, in Guildford, England, at the age of 65 from pneumonia
                    following a bout of influenza. By the time of his death, Carroll had left an indelible mark on
                    literature, mathematics, and photography.
                    <br><br>
                    Though Carroll is best remembered for the <strong>Alice</strong> books, his contributions to
                    mathematics, especially in logic and geometry, were significant. His work on syllogisms and recreational
                    mathematics influenced scholars and educators alike.
                    <br><br>
                    Carroll's death marked the end of a remarkable career, but his legacy endured. His
                    <strong>Alice</strong> books remain beloved classics, translated into hundreds of languages, adapted into films, plays, and
                    countless other forms of art. His ability to blend intellectual depth with playful storytelling
                    continues to inspire generations of readers.

            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</strong> tells the story of Alice, a curious young girl who
              follows a talking White Rabbit and tumbles down a rabbit hole into a <strong>fantastical world.</strong>
              <br><br>
              In Wonderland, she encounters bizarre characters like the <strong>Mad Hatter</strong>, the Cheshire Cat, and the Queen of
              Hearts, each presenting her with absurd challenges and riddles. As Alice navigates this chaotic, dreamlike
              world, she explores themes of identity, logic, and imagination. The story concludes when <strong>Alice awakens,
              realizing it was all a dream</strong>, leaving her with a fresh perspective on curiosity and creativity.
              <br><br>
              However, <strong>Alice's journey through Wonderland</strong> also highlights the absurdity of adult authority and the
              confusion that children often face in a world governed by arbitrary rules. Throughout her adventures, she
              struggles with understanding who she is and how she fits into a world where logic is turned upside down.
              Carroll uses these fantastical encounters to satirize Victorian society, questioning its rigid norms and
              expectations.
              <br><br>
              The novel's play with language and logic invites readers to embrace their imagination and question the
              limits of reality. By blending whimsical storytelling with deeper philosophical themes, <strong>Alice's Adventures</strong>
              in Wonderland has endured as a beloved classic, resonating with both children and adults alike for its
              imaginative spirit and its reflections on growing up.

            <h2>Reviews</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Lewis Carroll's classic</strong> is a masterpiece of fantasy literature, blending boundless imagination with rich
              symbolic storytelling. The journey of Alice offers readers an escape into a world where logic is upended,
              and anything is possible. Memorable characters like the eccentric <strong>Mad Hatter and the fiery Queen of Hearts
              enrich the surreal atmosphere.</strong>
              <br><br>
              The book's deeper themes, such as self-discovery and questioning authority, make it resonate beyond its
              classification as children's literature. Its whimsical humor and clever wordplay captivate readers of all
              ages. The narrative's ability to challenge conventional thinking through its paradoxes and absurdities has
              earned it a place in the literary canon for both young readers and adults alike.
              <br><br>
              What truly elevates <strong>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</strong> is its imaginative dialogue and the playful
              manipulation of language. Carroll's use of nonsense poetry and riddles offers not just entertainment, but
              also subtle critiques of societal norms, offering layers of meaning that can be interpreted in various
              ways over time.
              <br><br>
              In summary, <strong>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</strong> is a delightful and enduring work that stimulates the
              imagination while challenging conventional thinking, making it a timeless and rewarding read. Its charm
              lies not just in its surreal storytelling, but also in its profound exploration of identity, logic, and
              the absurdities of life.

            <h2>Publisher</h2>
            <p>
              The publication of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland in 1865 involved a complex process, with significant
              roles played by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson), illustrator John Tenniel, and the publishing
              house Macmillan & Co.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Printing and Issues:</strong> The first 2,000 copies were printed in Oxford, but Tenniel objected
              to the quality of the illustrations, which led to the rejection of the entire print run. Carroll subsequently
              ordered a new printing in London. The rejected copies were sold to D. Appleton & Co. in New York, forming
              the "Appleton Alice," a rare edition.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Macmillan & Co.:</strong> Macmillan was the official publisher and handled the subsequent prints
              of the book. Carroll self-financed the project, a common practice at the time, and Macmillan played a key role in
              distributing the work widely. The publisher's relationship with Carroll continued with later works like
              Through the Looking-Glass.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Manuscript and Legacy:</strong> Carroll initially wrote the story as a handwritten manuscript
              titled Alice's Adventures Underground, which he gifted to Alice Liddell. Later, this was expanded and adapted for
              publication. The original manuscript is now housed in the British Library.
